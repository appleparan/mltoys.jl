# This project is not MAINTAINED

# Mise.jl

* Personal project for forecasting Particulate Matter using machine learning technique
* Early implementation of my research based on [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) and [Julia v1.5](https://julialang.org/).
* This may not work now due to dependency issue and some unresolved bugs.
* I added tests before, but after some time, I didn't maintained tests.
